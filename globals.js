// GLOBALS - NO WINDOW !!!!

// __dirname    - path to current repository(directory)
// __filename   - path to current file
// require      - function to use modules (CommonJS)
// module       - info about current module (file)
// process      - info about the environment where the program is running

// These are global objects or variables that are accessible across entire appliction of Node

//There are two types of module system.. 1) CommonJS   2)ES6 modules
// CommonJS is the default Module used by node where we use require to import modules or files.. it is used because when nodeJS was introduced Javascript used to not have their inbuilt module system hence they took this from CommonJS but since built in modules has been introduced in ES6 we can use that too
// module is an object

// Refer to module.png image for reference

// function( exports, require, modules, __filename, __dirname ){
//refer to the screenshot.png in this directory
// }
